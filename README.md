# im_comtrend.py - Intermapper probe for Comtrend DSL modems

I needed to keep track of the Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) for my DSL modem and wrote this probe. See the full documentation at: github

It scrapes the web interface of a Comtrend DSL modem to retrieve its SNR values and other important operational characteristics. Here's the Status Window:

This has been tested with a Comtrend AR-5381U modem.
