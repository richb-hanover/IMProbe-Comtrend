# Intermapper probe for Comtrend DSL modem

I wanted to keep track of the Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) for my DSL modem. I was losing connections overnight, and wanted to prove to my ISP that this was happening.

This probe connects to, and scrapes the web interface of a Comtrend DSL modem to retrieve its SNR values and other important operational characteristics. 
This has been tested with a Comtrend AR-5381U modem.
Here's the Status Window:
